# Application of 2D unet for WMH segmentation with tensorflow and keras

Implementation of WMH segmentation based on this [repo](https://github.com/hongweilibran/wmh_ibbmTum) and its updated version (docker image: wmhchallenge/sysu_media_2)

Preprocessing requires rigid body transformation of your choice from FLAIR to its T1 counterpart.
