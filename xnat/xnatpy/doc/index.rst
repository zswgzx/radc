******************
XNAT Python Client
******************

A new XNAT client that exposes XNAT objects/functions as python
objects/functions.

.. warning::
    This is NOT pyxnat, but a new module which is not as mature but uses a different philisophy for the user interface. Pyxnat is located at: `https://pythonhosted.org/pyxnat/ <https://pythonhosted.org/pyxnat/>`_


The XNAT Python client is open-source (licensed under the Apache 2.0 license) and hosted on bitbucket at `https://bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/xnatpy <https://bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/xnatpy>`_

To get yourself a copy:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone https://<yourusername>@bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/xnatpy

or if you have a ssh key pair:

.. code-block:: bash

    hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/xnatpy

The official documentation can be found at `xnat.readthedocs.org <http://xnat.readthedocs.org>`_
